            <p class="align">Virat Kohli (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and occasional right-arm medium pace bowler. Kohli is married on 11 december 2017 with a bollywood actress Anushka Sharma. He is the current captain of the Indian team in all three formats of the game. In the Indian Premier League (IPL), he captains the Royal Challengers Bangalore.</p>

            <p class="align1">Virat Kohli Becomes The Fastest Cricketer To Score 10,000 Runs In One-Day Internationals.</p>
                    
            <p class="align">“King” Kohli comfortably bettered the record set by the man who was to Indian cricket for over two decades what the 29-year-old has been for the past few years.

Tendulkar took 259 innings to get there, while Kohli has so far batted in 205 innings. Fortune, too, was on Kohli’s side as West Indies skipper Jason Holder dropped his Indian counterpart on 44.

Seventeen summers ago, Tendulkar had ventured into what was then an unchartered territory, during a match against Australia. On Wednesday, Kohli became the 13th batsman to reach the milestone.

Not long ago, while the cricket world struggled to look for words to aptly describe Kohli’s phenomenal batting, his coach Ravi Shastri thought it would be wise to visit the bookstore, buy the latest edition of the Oxford dictionary and look for the adjectives that befit the captain and his superhuman feats.

“If I were you, I would visit the bookstore and pick up the Oxford dictionary,” Shastri had said after a Kohli century guided India to victory over South Africa in February.

Some years ago, Tendulkar, after scoring his 100th international century, said he would love to see an Indian—someone like Kohli or Rohit Sharma—break his records.
